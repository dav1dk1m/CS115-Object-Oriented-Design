# University of Regina_CS115: Object-Oriented Programming C++

### Assignment 1_Question 1
Design the program by using the structures to store the weather data for a particular month.
The program should have an array to store 12 months weather data. When the program runs, a prompt window will be shown for the users to enter data for each month. 
The Program then should display month-wise min., max. and average temperatures and rainfalls in a table-like format.  In addition, it should display the average min.,
the average max. and the average mean TEMPERATURE and RAINFALL of the entire year (12 months in total) at the end of the output.

### Assignment 1_Question 2
Similar to Question 1,design the program by using the structures and **'vector'** to store the weather data for a particular month.
The program should have an array to store 12 months weather data. When the program runs, a prompt window will be shown for the users to enter data for each month. 
The Program then should display month-wise min., max. and average temperatures and rainfalls in a table-like format.  In addition, it should display the average min.,
the average max. and the average mean TEMPERATURE and RAINFALL of the entire year (12 months in total) at the end of the output.
